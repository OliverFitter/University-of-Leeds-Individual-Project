# University-of-Leeds-Individual-Project
Firstly, thank you for taking the time to look at the code developed for this project.
Must change lines 19 and 23 on both scripts to match users working directory if you want to run scripts through Abaqus.
Advisable only to run the 'create initial UAV wing model.py' to see model from chapter 2.
Should user wish to run optimisation script, should be advised that the script will likely run for at least 30min (probs longer).
create layups.py creates all the possible layups that meet the 4 design rules
